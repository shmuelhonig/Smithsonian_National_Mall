# Smithsonian Map

This project uses JavaScript and Knockout.js to create a single page application of a Google map of the Smithsonian museums at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The app allows users to see locations both on the map (via markers) and a list view. The list view can be filtered and collapsed, and infowindows show each museum's address as provided by the FourSquare API. The project was completed as part of Udacity's Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree program.

# Usage

Open the index.html file in a browser window. When loading this app, please use your own Google Maps and FourSquare API keys. Thank you!
